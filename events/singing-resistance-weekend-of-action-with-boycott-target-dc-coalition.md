We are heeding the Singing Resistance’s nationwide weekend of action by joining with Boycott Target DC (and partners, including FreeDC) to call on Target to
 
* Affirm Target as a 4th Amendment workplace and to stop supporting ICE
* Restore Target's commitment to DEI initiatives they announced in 2020, and then rolled back as the current administration came into power

This will be a picket, so we’ll be trying that out at our Tuesday practice.

Call time TBD at Sabeh Coffee at the exit from Metro

Song from [Singing Resistance Songbook](https://docs.proton.me/doc?mode=open-url&token=PRAAJBVVKC#14y1s6CJV51u):
This is for our neighbors .. we will abolish ICE
Hold On
No one is getting left behind
We are many (Sue F)
