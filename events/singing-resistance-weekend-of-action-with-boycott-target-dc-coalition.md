summary: A singing picket in Columbia Heights, DC
---
We are heeding the Singing Resistance’s nationwide weekend of action by joining with Boycott Target DC (and partners, including FreeDC) to call on Target to
 
* Affirm Target as a 4th Amendment workplace and to stop supporting ICE
* Restore Target's commitment to DEI initiatives they announced in 2020, and then rolled back as the current administration came into power

This will be a picket, so we’ll be trying that out at our Tuesday practice (see below)

Call time TBD at Sabeh Coffee at the exit from Metro
