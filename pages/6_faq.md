# Frequently Asked Questions


## Is this legal?

Yes, we are exercising our first amendment to free speech. The RRC does NOT interfere with any law enforcement activity, nor does it engage in civil disobedience.


## Is this safe?

While we can’t make any guarantees, the RRC has not, to date, been concerned about our physical safety. The events we have attended have been calm and without incident. 

Our marshals keep alert for any signs that a situation might become dangerous. We wear printed, high-visibility vests to make our role and identity clear.  We have security protocols to keep everyone safe, including not sharing anyone’s identity or contact information without permission. We suggest members consult [security essentials for activists](https://activistchecklist.org/essentials/).

News outlets have taken pictures of the RRC singing at events. If you join the RRC, you may appear in print or televised media.

## Where does the RRC perform?

We go where there is a need to show strength and love to those targeted by the administration. We have performed at schools, churches, courthouses, consulates, federal buildings (e.g., the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Washington Monument), and as part of protests, rallies, and marches.

## What songs does the RRC sing or lead?

We match songs to the purpose and tone of the event. Our songs range from traditional protest songs to newer songs of resistance to brand new parodies. See the [RRC Songbook](/songs) for a list of songs we draw on.

## How can I join the RRC?

Check out the [Join Us page](/join).

## How do I get the RRC to come to my event? 

Instructions on how to request the RRC for music and/or songleading are on the [About the Rapid Response Choir page](/about).
