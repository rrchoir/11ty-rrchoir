# Rapid Response Choir

## Protecting our community through song

The Rapid Response Choir sings for truth, justice, and democracy – we stand against threats to the Constitution and our community.

Through inspiring, non-violent performances, we seek to:

* Generate and amplify public disapproval of dangerous and illegal policies, and efforts to dismantle democracy..
* Express outrage, bear witness, and call attention to injustices.
* Model “joy in resistance” to those uncertain of what to do, inspiring them to take action.
* Lend strength and show love to targeted communities and individuals.

When authoritarian forces seek to harm our neighbors and friends, the Rapid Response Choir will be there to sing truth to power.
