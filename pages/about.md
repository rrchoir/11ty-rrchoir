## Who we are

Currently, we are a group of Maryland and D.C. residents who want to call attention to violations of U.S. law and the Constitution and support those who have been affected by this administration. The RRC was founded in February 2025 by Peter B, a Maryland resident, who reached out to members of community and church choirs for those who share a vision of resistance through song.

## What we do

We sing and encourage others to sing with us. We assemble at rallies, schools, churches, protests, vigils, and other community events. We are a peaceful group. We do not engage in civil disobedience or disruption tactics. We do not interfere with law enforcement, but we will remind everyone of their rights under the Constitution.

## How to join the RRC

The RRC is open to everyone. No prior singing experience required. Learn more on our [Join Us page](https://rapidresponsechoir.org/join).

## Request the RRC to perform

Would you like to add the RRC’s voices to your event? We prefer advance warning but often can assemble at short notice, ready to sing for thirty minutes or longer if need be. To “book” the RRC, send your contact information, the date, time, and location of your event, its purpose, and its organizational sponsor to <admin@rapidresponsechoir.org>.
