## What's involved?

Everyone has different commitment levels, and you're welcome if:

* You only want to come to practices to find community and solidarity
* You can't come to practices, but will show up for scheduled events
* You're ready to be a Rapid Responder and show up to sing on a moment's notice.
* You want to help out in other ways, such as preparing materials, being a marshal at events, and others.

We encourage coming to practices, as we practice event tactics as well as music.

## Chapters
