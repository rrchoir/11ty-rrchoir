## [Sign up now](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/n7enY2yher1tWinWw4HqDhRGRULjE7YoadxYoewQ6Yc/)!
  
The RRC is open to everyone. No prior singing experience required. [Fill out our CryptPad form](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/n7enY2yher1tWinWw4HqDhRGRULjE7YoadxYoewQ6Yc/) to join the announcement mailing list, or to get in touch by Signal.

## What's involved?

Everyone has different commitment levels, and you're welcome if:

* You only want to come to practices to find community and solidarity
* You can't come to practices, but will show up for scheduled events
* You're ready to be a Rapid Responder and show up to sing on a moment's notice.

We encourage coming to practices, as we practice event tactics as well as music.

## Chapters

### NE DC and Maryland Suburbs

Our charter chapter! We practice most Tuesdays in central Hyattsville.
