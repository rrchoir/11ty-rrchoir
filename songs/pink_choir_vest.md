I know you wanted me to stay\
But I can't ignore the vision of a more inclusive day\
I heard that there's a special place\
Where all our voices matter in a real and thoughtful way  

I'm having wicked dreams\
of leaving MAGA dad\
I hear the protest songs\
I swear I'll be so glad\
I'm going off to save,\
Our one democracy\
He sees his baby girl\
I know he's gonna scream:  

God, what have you done\
You're a pink choir girl\
And you sing against Trump  

Oh daddy, I'm just speaking up\
For all those who cannot\
It's where I belong dressed in my  

Pink choir vest\
I'm gonna keep on singing\
in my pink choir vest\
I'm gonna keep on singing down in\
West Hyattsville\
I'm gonna keep on singing\
In my pink choir vest\
Pink choir vest  

We’re up and DOGE drops to  the floor\
Musk is in the sink as disapproval numbers soar\
Black ops ... don’t scare us in the least\
We’ll march on singing… in hope and love and peace  

I thank my hopeful dreams\
fighting autocracy\
Oh, Rapid Response Choir\
You've been so good to me\
I'm staying here to save\
our one democracy\
He sees his baby girl\
I know he's gonna scream  

God, what have you done\
You're a pink choir girl\
And you sing against Trump\
Oh daddy, I'm just speaking up\
For those who cannot\
It's where I belong dressed in my  

Pink choir vest\
I'm gonna keep on singing\
in my pink choir vest\
I'm gonna keep on singing down in\
West Hyattsville\
I'm gonna keep on singing\
In my pink choir vest\
Pink choir vest  

\[Bridge]\
And now, you have come to find\
This Administration\
isn’t what you had in mind  

Papa, let’s open up a way\
You can join the movement from a thousand miles away\
Saying…  

God, what have I done?\
Am I a pink choir guy?\
But I’ll stand for what’s right\
Oh papa, we’re all speaking up\
For those who cannot\
It's where we belong dressed in our  

Pink choir vests\
We're gonna keep on singing\
in our pink choir vests\
We're gonna keep on singing out a-\
-cross America\
We're gonna keep on singing\
In our pink choir vests\
Pink choir vests\
\[repeat]
