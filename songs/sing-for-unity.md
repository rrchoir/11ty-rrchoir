\[1]\
Sing for Unity, Sing! Sing for Unity, Sing!\
Sing for peace, sing for peace.\
Let your voice flutter like a butterfly’s wings\
Create a breeze, create a breeze.

\[2]\
Let the breeze become a wave, let the breeze become a storm\
Weaving around the globe\
Let us connect, let us connect in a storm\
Of wishes for love, for unity, and hope!

*Repeat and then turn into a round singing \[1] and \[2] at the same time, then finally go to Outro*

Outro:\
Sing for Unity, Sing for Unity, Sing for Unity, Sing for Unity *(repeat, then end on an extra “Sing”)*
