# O Canada

O Canada!  
Our home and native land!  
True patriot love in all of us command.  
With glowing hearts we see thee rise,  
The True North strong and free!  
From far and wide,  
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.  
Et ta valeur, de foi trempée,  
Protégera nos foyers et nos droits.   
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.

this instead.
