O Canada!\
Our home and native land!\
True patriot love in all of us command.\
With glowing hearts we see thee rise,\
The True North strong and free!\
From far and wide,\
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.\
Et ta valeur, de foi trempée,\
Protégera nos foyers et nos droits.\
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.
