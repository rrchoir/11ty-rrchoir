I’d like to build the world a home and furnish it with love,\
Grow apple trees and honey bees, and snow white turtle doves.\
I’d like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony \
I’d like to hold it in my arms  and keep it company \
I’d like to see the world for once all standing hand in hand \
And hear them echo through the hills for peace throughout the land.

That’s the song I hear, let the world sing today \
A song of peace that echoes on and never goes away \
Put your hand in my hand. Let’s begin today.\
Put your hand in my hand. Help me find the way.

I’d like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony, \
I’d like to hold it in my arms  and keep it company.\
I’d like to see the world for once all standing hand in hand \
And hear them echo through the hills for peace throughout the land.
