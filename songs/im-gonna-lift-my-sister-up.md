I'm gonna lift my sister up, she is not heavy (3x)\
If I don't lift her up (x2)\
If I don't lift her up, I will fall down

If I don't lift my brother up, he is not...

I'm gonna lift my neighbor, she is not...

I'm gonna lift my people up, they are not...

We're gonna lift each other up, we are not...
