1. Be song of praise in prison, For worried be relief,\
Be power of the people, Be budding of the leaf,\
Be haven for the hunted, Be riches for the ragged,\
For wanderers be a stream, Be the vision, Be the dream (x2)

2. Be song of hope in horror, For hungry be the bread,\
Be freedom for the captives, Be morning light ahead,\
Be solace in the sorrow, Be fragrance of tomorrow, \
In dungeons be a gleam, Be the vision, Be the dream (x2)

*Bridge:*\
We have a weapon, a weapon in the struggle,\
That no one can destroy, that nothing can resist,\
We have the vision, the vision of the victory,\
Our dream will always be to be the dream, yes be, be the dream,

*\[Repeat verses 1 & 2]*
