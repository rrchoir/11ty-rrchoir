# When the Order is Illegal, Disobey!
_Parody lyrics to She'll be Comin' Round the Mountain by Joseph Dalaker_
  
1.  When the order is illegal, disobey (Disobey!)  
When the order is illegal, disobey   
(Disobey!)  
When the order is illegal  
Don’t just be a pliant beagle  
When the order is illegal, disobey!  
(Disobey!)  
   
2.  When the boss is unelected, disobey  
(Disobey!)  
When the boss is unelected, disobey   
(Disobey!)  
When the boss is unelected   
And says your job’s unprotected  
Tell him his cars are defective.  
Disobey!  
(Disobey!)  
   
3.  If the Muskrat RIFs* your people, disobey  
(Disobey!)  
If the Muskrat RIFs your people, disobey  
(Disobey!)  
If retire you don’t wanna  
Tell him “Go back home to Tshwane”**  
If the Muskrat RIFs your people, disobey!  
(Disobey!)  
   
4.  When the crook says “stop the payments” disobey.  
(Disobey!)  
When the crook says “stop the payments” disobey.  
(Disobey!)  
When the crook says “stop the payments”  
Think of all his lawsuit claimants  
When the crook says “stop the payments” disobey  
(Disobey!)  
   
5.  When he says to whitewash hist’ry disobey   
(Disobey!)  
When he says to whitewash hist’ry disobey  
(Disobey!)  
It’s no wonder, it’s no myst’ry,  
Everyone’s a part of hist’ry  
If you love both Truth and Country disobey!   
(Disobey!)  
   
6.  If the orders say to censor, disobey.  
(Disobey)  
If the orders say to censor, disobey (disobey)  
If you say you love your freedom  
Don’t ban books, instead just read ‘em  
Or you always could just leave ‘em. Disobey!  
(Disobey!)  
   
7.  If your orders are to kidnap, disobey (Disobey)  
If your orders are to kidnap, disobey (Disobey)  
Speech and assembly give us freedom  
So protect ‘em—we all need ‘em  
Donny uses goons to cheat ‘em. Disobey!  
(Disobey!)  
   
8.  If you believe his lies no longer, disobey  
(Disobey)  
If you believe his lies no longer disobey  
(Disobey)   
Don’t engage in insurrection  
Just cause he can’t get erections  
The Constitution needs protection. Disobey!  
(Disobey!)  
   
9.  If they say you’re out of order, disobey.  (Disobey!)  
If they say you’re out of order, disobey.  (Disobey!)  
If they say you’re out of order,  
Then just what were you elected for?   
So make your voice like thunder. Disobey!  
(Disobey!)  
   
🎵  
10.  When the order is illegal disobey  
(Disobey!)  
When the order is illegal disobey  
(Disobey!)  
He’s a tyrant, he’s a felon,  
We’re not buyin’ what he’s sellin’  
Tell him fuck right off to hell and  
Disobey!  
(DISOBEY!)
