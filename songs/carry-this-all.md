Pitch: F
category: general
notes: 'This song was almost lost. Blakely presented this at a song workshop, as
  the first iteration of her song "The 3rd gate: Sorrows of the World". A friend
  sang it at a gathering years later, and Blakely did not remember having
  composed it: she loved it and asked where it came from.'

**You do not** **ca**rry this **all** alone.\
No, **you do not ca**rry this **all** alone.\
This is **way** too big for you to **ca**rry this **on** your own.\
So, **you do not ca**rry this **all** alone.
