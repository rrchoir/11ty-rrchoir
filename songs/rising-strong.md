Part 1:

Oh take my hand now, yes you belong\
And lift your voice now, we’ll sing this song\
And we will root down into the ground now\
We’re rising strong, yeah, we’re rising strong

Parts 2 and 3:

Ooooo….

Parts 4 and 5:

And we are warriors of the light\
And we are stronger when we unite\
We are here to waken the love\
We are rising strong, yeah we’re rising strong!
