# We Are the Power
  
We are the power and we know it in our bones  
We are not alone and we grow stronger ev’ry day.  
We take down the tyrants with our courage and our spirit.  
We are the strong and we grow stronger ev’ry day.  
  
[Chorus]  
Ev’ry day! Ev’ry day!  
Fueled by generations we will not obey!  
(repeat both lines)  
  
We are the workers, built this nation from the ground.  
We can shut this whole thing down and we grow stronger ev’ry day  
Their money and their greed won’t bring the people what they need.  
  
*Chorus*  
  
  
We are the women  
They will never take us down  
We rise up from solid ground  
And we grow stronger every day  
We won’t give up the fight  
For our bodies and our rights  
We are strong and we grow stronger every day  
  
We are a rainbow  
Beautiful and proud  
We raise our voices loud  
And we grow stronger every day  
They try to make us disappear  
But we are here and we are queer  
We are strong and we grow stronger every day  
  
We are the seeds  
And we are nurtured by the earth  
In the darkness is rebirth  
And we grow stronger every day  
We will sing and shout  
Until we force the rich boys out  
We are strong and we grow stronger every day
