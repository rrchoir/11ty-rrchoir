# We Are the Power

**We** are the **pow**er and we **know** it in our bones\
We are not a**lone** and we grow **strong**er ev’ry **day**.\
We take down the **ty**rants with our **cou**rage and our **spi**rit.\
We are the **strong** and we grow **strong**er ev’ry **day**.  

\[Chorus]\
Ev’ry day! Ev’ry day!\
Fueled by generations we will not obey!\
(repeat both lines)  

We are the **work**ers, built this **na**tion from the **ground**.\
We can shut this whole thing **down** and we grow **strong**er ev’ry **day**\
Their **mon**ey and their greed won’t bring the **peo**ple what they need.  \
We are the **strong** and we grow **strong**er ev’ry **day**. 

*Chorus*  

**We** are the **wo**men,\
They will never take us down\
We rise up from solid ground\
And we grow stronger every day\
We won’t give up the fight\
For our bodies and our rights\
We are strong and we grow stronger every day  

We are a rainbow\
Beautiful and proud\
We raise our voices loud\
And we grow stronger every day\
They try to make us disappear\
But we are here and we are queer\
We are strong and we grow stronger every day  

We are the seeds\
And we are nurtured by the earth\
In the darkness is rebirth\
And we grow stronger every day\
We will sing and shout\
Until we force the rich boys out\
We are strong and we grow stronger every day
