**We** are the **pow**er and we **know** it in our bones\
We are not a**lone** and we grow **strong**er ev’ry **day**.\
We take down the **ty**rants with our **cou**rage and our **spi**rit.\
We are the **strong** and we grow **strong**er ev’ry **day**.  

\[Chorus]\
Ev’ry day! Ev’ry day!\
Fueled by generations we will not obey!\
(repeat both lines)  

We are the **work**ers, built this **na**tion from the **ground**.\
We can shut this whole thing **down** and we grow **strong**er ev’ry **day**\
Their **mon**ey and their greed won’t bring the **peo**ple what they need.  \
We are the **strong** and we grow **strong**er ev’ry **day**. 

*Chorus*  

**We** are the **wo**men,\
They will **ne**ver take us **down**\
We rise **up** from solid **ground**\
And we grow **strong**er every **day**\
We **won’t** give up the **fight**\
For our **bod**ies and our **rights**\
We are **strong** and we grow **strong**er every **day**  

**We** are a **rain**bow\
**Beau**tiful and **proud**\
We **raise** our voices **loud**\
And we grow **strong**er every **day**\
They **try** to make us **dis**appear\
But we are **here** and we are **queer**\
We are **strong** and we grow **strong**er every day  

**We** are the **seeds**\
And we are **nur**tured by the **earth**\
In the **dark**ness is re**birth**\
And we grow **strong**er every **day**\
**We** will sing and **shout**\
Until we **force** the rich boys **out**\
We are **strong** and we grow **strong**er every day
