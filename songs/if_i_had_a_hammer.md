  Written in 1949 for the Labor Movement, it was considered to be subversive as
  words like "peace" and "freedom" were seen by the government as aligning with
  Communist ideology. As a result, the Weavers were blacklisted. The song gained
  popularity in the Civil Rights movement, anti-war protests, and beyond. Peter,
  Paul, and Mary added “and my sisters” in their 1962 recording. Emma's
  Revolution changed "my brothers and my sisters" to "all of the resisters" in
  2017.

If I had a hammer, I'd hammer in the morning\
I'd hammer in the evening all over this land\
I'd hammer out danger, I'd hammer out warning\
I'd hammer out love between all of the resisters\
All over this land, ooh  

If I had a bell, I'd ring it in the morning\
I'd ring it in the evening all over this land\
I'd ring out danger, I'd ring out a warning\
I'd ring out love between all of the resisters\
All over this land, ooh  

If I had a song, I'd sing it in the morning\
I'd sing it in the evening all over this land\
I'd sing out danger, I'd sing out a warning\
I'd sing out love between all of the resisters\
All over this land, ooh  

Well, I got a hammer, and I got a bell\
I've got a song to sing all over this land\
It's the hammer of justice, it's the bell of freedom\
It's a song about love between all of the resisters\
All over this land  

It's the hammer of justice\
It's the bell of freedom\
It's a song about love between all of the resisters\
All over this land
