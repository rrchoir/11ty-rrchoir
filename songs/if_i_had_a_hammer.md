# If I Had a Hammer

If I had a hammer, I'd hammer in the morning  
I'd hammer in the evening all over this land  
I'd hammer out danger, I'd hammer out warning  
I'd hammer out love between my brothers and my sisters  
All over this land, ooh  
  
  
If I had a bell, I'd ring it in the morning  
I'd ring it in the evening all over this land  
I'd ring out danger, I'd ring out a warning  
I'd ring out love between my brothers and my sisters  
All over this land, ooh  
  
  
If I had a song, I'd sing it in the morning  
I'd sing it in the evening all over this land  
I'd sing out danger, I'd sing out a warning  
I'd sing out love between my brothers and my sisters  
All over this land, ooh  
  
  
Well, I got a hammer, and I got a bell  
I've got a song to sing all over this land  
It's the hammer of justice, it's the bell of freedom  
It's a song about love between my brothers and my sisters  
All over this land  
  
It's the hammer of justice  
It's the bell of freedom  
It's a song about love between my brothers and my sisters
