# You’ll Never Walk Alone
 
When you walk through a storm  
Keep your head up high  
And don’t be afraid of the dark.  
  
At the end of the storm  
Is a golden sky  
And the sweet, silver song of a lark.  
  
Walk on through the wind,  
Walk on through the rain,  
Though your dreams be tossed and blown.  
  
Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart,  
And you’ll never walk alone!  
You’ll never walk alone.
