# Kilmar and the Felon-in-Chief 

_Parody lyrics by Joe Dalaker & Peter B. Tune of Kingston Trio's "Charlie and the M T A"_  ([Recording](/_Media/kilmar.m4a), [Original Kingston Trio on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbtkL5_f6-4))

Oh let me tell you about  
Kilmar Abrego García  
And injustices against that man.  
Somebody threatened his mama’s pupusería  
And that’s when his troubles began.  
  
A judge already had ruled  
That he wasn’t MS-13  
And that he just wanted to flee.  
But our Felon-in-Chief kidnapped him out of the country  
In an act of tyranny!  
  
Oh was he ever returned!?  
No! He hasn’t returned  
And his fate is still unlearned  
      (What a scandal)  
We will protest forever  
Outside this courthouse*  
Until Kilmar is returned!

Judge Xinis ruled that it was all wrong  
and he must be returned to the States  
but the DOJ can't 
understand words  
like the meaning of "facilitate"

Oh was he ever returned!?  
No! He hasn’t returned  
And his fate is still unlearned  
      (What a scandal)  
We will protest forever  
Outside this courthouse*  
Until Kilmar is returned!
  
  
* or wherever the protest is.  Outside the White House.  At this embassy’s front door.  In the halls of Congress.  Outside this office.  Etc.
