*Parody lyrics by Joe Dalaker & Peter B. Tune of Kingston Trio's "Charlie and the M T A"*  ([Recording](/_Media/kilmar.m4a), [Original Kingston Trio on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbtkL5_f6-4))

Oh let me tell you about\
Kilmar Abrego García\
And injustices against that man.\
Somebody threatened his mama’s pupusería\
And that’s when his troubles began.  

A judge already had ruled\
That he wasn’t MS-13\
And that he just wanted to flee.\
But our Felon-in-Chief kidnapped him out of the country\
In an act of tyranny!  

Oh was he ever returned!?\
No! He hasn’t returned\
And his fate is still unlearned\
      (What a scandal)\
We will protest forever\
Outside this courthouse*\
Until Kilmar is returned!

Judge Xinis ruled that it was all wrong\
and he must be returned to the States\
but the DOJ can't 
understand words\
like the meaning of "facilitate"

Oh was he ever returned!?\
No! He hasn’t returned\
And his fate is still unlearned\
      (What a scandal)\
We will protest forever\
Outside this courthouse*\
Until Kilmar is returned!

* or wherever the protest is.  Outside the White House.  At this embassy’s front door.  In the halls of Congress.  Outside this office.  Etc.
