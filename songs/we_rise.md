# We Rise


We rise, humbly hearted.  
Rise, won′t be divided.  
Rise. With spirit to guide us. Rise.  

_Chorus_  
In hope, In prayer, We find ourselves here  
In hope, In prayer, We're right here _(repeat)_  

We rise. All of the children.  
Rise, Elders with wisdom.   
Rise. Ancestors surround us. Rise.   

_Chorus_

We rise. Up from the wreckage.   
Rise. With tears and with courage.  
Rise. Fighting for life. We rise  

_Chorus_  

We rise, humbly hearted.  
Rise, won′t be divided.  
Rise. With spirit to guide us. Rise.
