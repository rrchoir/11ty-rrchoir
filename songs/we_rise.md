  Quote from Batya Levine: “We Rise” came through right after the 2016 election.
  It was a moment of  deep fear and despair, as we watched a campaign built on
  white supremacy  and racism win. The results came in a few weeks after I had
  returned  from Standing Rock, and in the wake of the election, I felt a
  profound  sense of hopelessness. I needed to believe that collective power
  and  resistance was possible in the face of such great unknown. I
  reached  inward for a prayer, for a shred of hope, and what I found was
  the  powerful and prayerful resistance I had witnessed and experienced
  at  Standing Rock. In that moment, I started to sing, praying into my
  bones  that vision of holy resistance. 

   This song is one small attempt  at holding onto that vision, and praying it into our collective bones.  Since 2016 we’ve been through so much. This song feels as potent for me  today as it did when it came to me. In this time when white supremacy  and fascism are so clearly lifting their heads, may we truly center the  resistance and vision of Black folks, Indigenous and Native peoples,  communities of color, immigrants and refugees. May we believe in our  collective power and resilience, and learn to LIVE it, as we work to  dismantle the oppressive forces within ourselves and in the world around  us. No matter what struggles lie ahead, may we keep fighting and rising  for and with each other.

We rise, humbly hearted.\
Rise, won′t be divided.\
Rise. With spirit to guide us. Rise.  

*Chorus*\
In hope, In prayer, We find ourselves here\
In hope, In prayer, We're right here *(repeat)*  

We rise. All of the children.\
Rise, Elders with wisdom.\
Rise. Ancestors surround us. Rise.   

*Chorus*

We rise. Up from the wreckage.\
Rise. With tears and with courage.\
Rise. Fighting for life. We rise  

*Chorus*  

We rise, humbly hearted.\
Rise, won′t be divided.\
Rise. With spirit to guide us. Rise.
