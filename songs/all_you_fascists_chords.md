[Verse 1]
G
I'm gonna tell all you fascists, and you may be surprised:
C                            G
The people in this world are getting organized.
                D                            G
You're bound to lose, you fascists, bound to lose.
 
[Chorus]
C                         G
All you fascists bound to lose! (I said!)
C                         G
All you fascists bound to lose! (Yessir!)

All you fascists bound to lose!

There's people of every nation, marching side by side.

Marching 'cross these fields where a million fascists died.
                D                            G
You're bound to lose, you fascists, bound to lose.

Race hatred cannot stop us. This one thing I know.

Your poll tax and your Jim Crow greed have got to go
                D                            G
You're bound to lose, you fascists, bound to lose.


[Verse T]
G
Trans hatred cannot stop us. We'll go to our drag shows
C                                  G
Your sports bans and your bathroom laws have to to go
                D                            G
You're bound to lose, you fascists, bound to lose.

I'm going into this battle. I won't take no gun.

We'll end this world of slavery before this battle's won.

You're bound to lose, you fascists, bound to lose.
