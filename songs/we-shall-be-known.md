We shall be known by the company we keep\
By the ones who circle round to tend these fires\
We shall be known by the ones who sow and reap\
The seeds of change, alive from deep within the earth



It is time now, it is time now that we thrive\
It is time we lead ourselves into the well\
It is time now, and what a time to be alive\
In this Great Turning we shall learn to lead in love (2x)

Repeat first verse.
