notes: 'Lyrics are inspired by a tweet by Senator John Lewis, a civil rights
  leader, on June 27 2018: "Do not get lost in a sea of despair. Be hopeful, be
  optimistic. Our struggle is not the struggle of a day, a week, a month or a
  year, it is the struggle of a lifetime. Never, ever, be afraid to make some
  noise and get in good trouble. Necessary trouble."'
