  that exist in the United States, and against the sufferings of millions during
  the Great Depression.

*Chords*: G D A D

This land is your land, and this land is my land\
From California to the New York Island\
From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream Waters\
This land was made for you and me  

As I went walking that ribbon of highway\
And I saw above me that endless skyway\
I saw below me that golden valley\
This land was made for you and me  

I roamed and rambled and I followed my footsteps\
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts\
All around me a voice was a-sounding\
This land was made for you and me  

There was a big high wall there that tried to stop me\
Sign was painted, said, "Private Property"\
But on the back side, it didn't say nothing\
This land was made for you and me  

When the sun comes shining, then I was strolling\
And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling\
A voice come chanting as the fog was lifting\
This land was made for you and me  

\[Repeat 1st verse.:  ]
