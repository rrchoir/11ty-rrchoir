# This Land is Your Land

_Chords_: G D A D
  
This land is your land, and this land is my land  
From California to the New York Island  
From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream Waters  
This land was made for you and me  
  
  
As I went walking that ribbon of highway  
And I saw above me that endless skyway  
I saw below me that golden valley  
This land was made for you and me  

I roamed and rambled and I followed my footsteps  
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts  
All around me a voice was a-sounding  
This land was made for you and me  
  
There was a big high wall there that tried to stop me  
Sign was painted, said, "Private Property"  
But on the back side, it didn't say nothing  
This land was made for you and me  
  
When the sun comes shining, then I was strolling  
And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling  
A voice come chanting as the fog was lifting  
This land was made for you and me  
  
[Repeat 1st verse.:  ]
