notes: This song was written by Sarah Dan Jones just after September 11, 2001.
  It is the chorus of a larger piece that was created to help ease fears and
  seek solace following the tragedy.

**Part 1**\
Breathe in, Breathe out. (4x before starting 2nd part)\
\
**Part 2**\
When I breathe in,\
I’ll breathe in peace.\
When I breathe out,\
I’ll breathe out love
