# Which Side Are You On?

Come ALL of you good workers  
Good news to you I'll tell  
Of how that good old union  
Has come in here to dwell  

[Chorus]  
Which side are you on? [x4]

My daddy was a miner  
And I'm a miner's son  
And I'll stick with the union  
Till every battle's won   …     Chorus

They say in Harlan County  
There are no neutrals there  
You'll either be a union man  
Or a thug for J.H. Blair    …  Chorus

Oh, workers can you stand it?  
Oh, tell me how you can  
Will you be a lousy scab  
Or will you be a man? … Chorus  

Don't scab for the bosses  
Don't listen to their lies  
Us poor folks haven't got a chance  
Unless we organize … Chorus


Avelo was an airline, 
But their soul they did sell  
They shackle up their passengers,  
And fly them straight to hell  … Chorus
