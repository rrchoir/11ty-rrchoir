  This song originated from a 1931 protest against the violent actions of coal company thugs hired by mine owners to intimidate union organizers during the Harlan County War in Kentucky. Written by Florence Reece, the wife of union organizer Sam Reece, the song became a rallying cry for the labor movement and has since been adapted for various social justice causes, including the Civil Rights Movement.

**Original Union Verses**

Come ALL of you good workers\
Good news to you I'll tell\
Of how that good old union\
Has come in here to dwell  

\[Chorus]\
Which side are you on? \[x4]

My daddy was a miner\
And I'm a miner's son\
And I'll stick with the union\
Till every battle's won   …     Chorus

They say in Harlan County\
There are no neutrals there\
You'll either be a union man\
Or a thug for J.H. Blair    …  Chorus

Oh, workers can you stand it?\
Oh, tell me how you can\
Will you be a lousy scab\
Or will you be a man? … Chorus  

Don't scab for the bosses\
Don't listen to their lies\
Us poor folks haven't got a chance\
Unless we organize … Chorus

**Alternate verses**

Come ALL of you good people\
Good new to you I'll tell\
Of how this good old country\
Has come in here to dwell

\[Chorus]\
Which side are you on? \[x4]

My parents both were fighters\
And I'm a fighter too\
And I'll stick with equality\
Till every battle's won ... Chorus

They say in this great country\
There is democracy\
You'll either be for justice\
Or a thug for tyranny ... Chorus

Don't bend down for the bosses\
You can save some lives\
Us common folks don't have a chance\
Unless we organize ... Chorus

**Avelo**

Oh Avelo, can you stand it\
Oh tell me how you can\
Will you be compliant\
Or will you take a stand? ... Chorus

Avelo was an airline, 
But their soul they did sell\
They shackle up their passengers,\
*And fly them straight to hell*  … Chorus
