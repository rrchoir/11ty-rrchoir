There once was a union maid, she never was afraid\
Of goons and ginks and company finks and the deputy sheriffs who made the raid.\
She went to the union hall when a meeting it was called,\
And when the Legion boys come 'round\
She always stood her ground.

*Chorus:*\
Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,\
I'm sticking to the union, I'm sticking to the union.\
Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,\
I'm sticking to the union 'til the day I die.

This union maid was wise to the tricks of company spies,\
She couldn't be fooled by a company stool, she'd always organize the guys.\
She always got her way when she struck for better pay.\
She'd show her card to the National Guard\
And this is what she'd say

*Chorus*

You women who want to be free, take a little tip from me\
Break outa that mold we've all been sold, you got a fighting hist-to-ree\
The fight for women's rights with workers must unite\
Like Mother Jones, move those bones to the front of every fight!

*Chorus*

A woman's struggle is hard even with a union card\
She's got to stand on her own two feet& not be a servant of the male elite\
It's time to take a stand, keep working hand in hand\
There's a job that's got to be done & a fight that's got to be won

*Chorus*

(Anne Feeney lyrics)

When this song was first sung \
Our fight had just begun\
And union maids in the union trades\
Organized 'til the job was done\
And lady's auxiliaries Of giant factories\
Side-by-side, they won their pride In CIO victories

*Chorus*

Now union maids are found\
In coal mines underground\
Climbing to new heights on construction sites\
And they'll never keep us down\
In offices and schools\
We'll redefine those rules\
Working every day toward comparable pay\
And with union men we say

*Chorus*
