\[Verse 1]\
I'm gonna tell you fascists, and you may be surprised:\
People in this world are getting organized.\
You're bound to lose, you fascists, bound to lose.  

\[Chorus]\
All you fascists bound to lose!\
All you fascists bound to lose!\
All you fascists bound to lose!\
You're bound to lose! You fascists, bound to lose!  

\[Verse 2]\
There's people of every nation, marching side by side.\
Marching 'cross these fields where a million fascists died.\
You're bound to lose, you fascists, bound to lose.  

\[Chorus]\
All you fascists bound to lose! (Yessir!)\
All you fascists bound to lose!\
All you fascists bound to lose!\
You're bound to lose! You fascists, bound to lose!  

\[Verse 3]\
Race hatred cannot stop us. This one thing I know.\
Your poll tax and your Jim Crow greed have got to go\
You're bound to lose, you fascists, bound to lose.  

\[Verse T]\
Trans hatred cannot stop us. We'll go to our drag shows\
Your sports bans and your bathroom laws have to to go\
You're bound to lose, you fascists, bound to lose.  

\[Verse DC 1]\
The district is our home, self-rule is the way,\
Our fundamental rights you cannot strip away\
You're bound to lose, you fascists, bound to lose  

\[Verse DC 2]\
We're half-a-million strong, people of every kind\
If you eff around, then you will come to find:\
You're bound to lose, you fascists, bound to lose  

\[Chorus]\
All you fascists bound to lose! (I said!)\
All you fascists bound to lose! (Yessir!)\
All you fascists bound to lose!\
You're bound to lose! You fascists, bound to lose!  

\[Verse 4]\
I'm going into battle. I won't take no gun.\
We'll end this world of hatred before this battle's won.\
You're bound to lose, you fascists, bound to lose.  

\[Chorus x 2]\
All you fascists bound to lose! (Yessir!)\
All you fascists bound to lose!\
All you fascists bound to lose!\
You're bound to lose! You fascists, bound to lose! (I said!)  

All you fascists bound to lose! (Yessir!)\
All you fascists bound to lose!\
All you fascists bound to lose!\
You're bound to lose! You fascists, bound to lose!
