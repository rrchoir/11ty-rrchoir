notes: "The phrase \"Joy is an act of resistance\" originated with
  African-American poet Toi Derricotte in the 1980s. The idea has since been
  adopted and expanded upon by various movements, particularly within Black
  feminism and queer activism, to describe how pursuing joy, even in the face of
  oppression and violence, is a powerful way to affirm existence, build
  community, and sustain energy for social change. The phrase has become The
  Resistance Revival Chorus' unofficial motto. "

What the world needs now, is joy in resistance\
We will fight the good fight, with or without your assistance\
Move out of the way, if you can't support the mission\
What the world needs now, is joy ....

*(Repeat, replacing "joy" with "faith", "love", "hope", "joy")*
