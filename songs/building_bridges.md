  In 1981, the British government decided to allow the US to store cruise
  missiles at the RAF base in Greenham. A group of women started to camp there
  to protest, following a 10-day, 120-mile march. The camp eventually became a
  central point for the British Peace movement. The camp closed in 2000 and
  became a Commemorative and Historic Site to honor the nuclear disarmament
  movement.


  Many songs came out of the protests, all attributed to â€œThe women of the Greenham Common Peace Camp", and not credited to individuals. "There's been lots of women involved one way, or another:  women writing songs (and adapting well known men's songs); women inspiring songs, listening, joining in, collecting songs, singing for music-writing, writing-out words [...] We felt, because it would be impossible to name _all_ the women, many unknown to us, [...]  there would be no 'credits' list."
