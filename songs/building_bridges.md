  In 1981, the British government decided to allow the US to store cruise
  missiles at the RAF base in Greenham. A group of women started to camp there
  to protest. The camp became a central point for the British Peace movement.
  The camp closed in 2000 and became a Commemorative and Historic Site to honor
  the nuclear disarmament movement.


  Many songs came out of the protests, all attributed to â€œThe women of the Greenham Common Peace Camp", and not credited to individuals.
