*Verse 1:*\
Well, back in 1776\
when our country came to be\
The tea was that they taxed our tea without our consent\
And so we threw it in the sea\
Are you ready? Hey! Are you ready for this?\
I’ve got a document you might wanna see\
The founding fathers had a lot of thoughts\
About how government ought to be  

*Chorus*:  

Bum bum bum\
The government works for us\
Bum bum bum\
The government works for us\
Not a billionaire man and a Putin stan,\
The government works for us\
Hey! You’ve got a job to do\
The government works for us  

*Verse 2*:\
Well our country isn’t perfect and it’s taken a while\
But we’ve slowly won our rights\
And now these clowns think they can whittle ‘em down\
And that we’ll give em up without a fight\
Are you happy, are you satisfied?\
How long can you stand the heat?\
You can count on we the people gettin’ organized\
We’re bringing more next time we meet  

*Verse 3:*\
They’re taking everything that made America great\
And they’re burning it to the ground\
They’re flooding the zone\
with acts of senseless hate\
To kick us while we’re down\
But we’re ready, yes we’re ready for you\
We’re standing right where we oughta be\
We call it “of the people, by` the people, for the people”\
Not an oligarchic monarchy!
