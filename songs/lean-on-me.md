Sometimes in our lives we all have pain, we all have sorrow. \
But if we are wise we know that there’s always tomorrow.

Chorus: \
Lean on me when you’re not strong, \
and I’ll be your friend, I’ll help you carry on, \
for it won’t be long ’til I’m gonna need \
somebody to lean on

Please swallow your pride if I have things you need to borrow, \
For no one can fill those of your needs that you won’t let show.\
\[Chorus]

If there is a load you have to bear that you can’t carry\
I’m right up the road, I’ll share your load if you just call me.\
\[Chorus]

Just call on me brother when you need a hand. \
We all need somebody to lean on.\
I just might have a problem that you’d understand. \
We all need somebody to lean on.
