They’ve no **bags** to pack. They were **forced** to go.\
They're **lay**ing on a **cold** hard floor.\
They **did**n’t get a **chance** to say goodbye.\
The **place** is smellin’, they’re **gett**in’ sick.\
The **guards** are yellin’, **wav**in’ their sticks.\
The con**di**tions are so **aw**ful they could **die**.

So re**mem**ber to **pray** for them.\
It’s **time** we all stand **up** with them.\
They’re **won**d’rin’ if they’ll **e**ver be let go,\
Sayin’: “I'm **lea**vin' **on** an ICE plane,\
**Don't** know if **I'll** be back again…\
Oh **please**! Don’t make me **go**.” 

So **many** times, we’ve **let** them down.\
We **took** them just be**cause** they’re brown. \
It **seems** that we’re no **lon**ger civilized. \
They **did** their best to **fol**low our laws.\
We ar**rest**ed them with**out** just cause.\
If **they** come back, they'll **still** be trauma**tized**. 

So re**mem**ber to **pray** for them.\
It’s **time** we all stand **up** with them.\
They’re **wond**’rin’ if they’ll **e**ver be let go,\
Sayin’: “I'm **lea**vin' **on** an ICE plane,\
**Don't** know if **I'll** be back again…\
Oh **help**! Don’t make me **go**.”

The time has **come** for them to **go** away.\
Even **though** they have the **right** to stay,\
We’ll **make** them march, in **chains**, up that gangway.\
Let’s **work** towards a **time** to come,\
When **they** won’t have to **leave** their home,\
And **for** a time when **they** won't have to **say**:

**“**Re**mem**ber to **pray** for me.\
I’m **ho**pin’ you'll stand **up** with me,\
I’m **wond**’rin’ if they’ll **ever** let me go.\
I'm **lea**vin' **on** an ICE plane,\
**Don't** know if **I'll** be back again…\
Please **help**! Don’t make me **go**.”

“Yes, I'm **lea**vin' **on** an ICE plane,\
**Don't** know if **I'll** be back again…\
This **hell**, it scares me **so**!”
