  Often referred to as "The Black National Anthem," *Lift Every Voice and
  Sing* was a hymn written as a poem by NAACP leader James Weldon Johnson in
  1900. His brother, John Rosamond Johnson (1873-1954), composed the music for
  the lyrics. A choir of 500 schoolchildren at the segregated Stanton School,
  where James Weldon Johnson was principal,  first performed the song in public
  in Jacksonville, Florida to celebrate President Abraham Lincoln's birthday.




  At the turn of the 20th century, Johnson's lyrics eloquently captured the solemn yet hopeful appeal for the liberty of Black Americans. Set against the religious invocation of God and the promise of freedom, the song was later adopted by NAACP and prominently used as a rallying cry during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s.

Lift ev'ry voice and sing
till earth and heaven ring,
Ring with the harmonies of liberty.
Let our rejoicing rise
high as the list'ning skies;
Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.
Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us;
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us;
Facing the rising sun
of our new day begun,
Let us march on till victory is won.

**Additional Verses**\
\
Stony the road we trod,
bitter the chast'ning rod,
Felt in the days when hope unborn had died.
Yet with a steady beat,
have not our weary feet
Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?
We have come over a way that with tears has been watered.
We have come, treading our path thru' the blood of the slaughtered,
Out from the gloomy past,
till now we stand at last
Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.

God of our weary years,
God of our silent tears,
Thou who hast brought us thus far on the way,
Thou who hast by thy might
led us into the light,
Keep us forever in the path, we pray.
Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met thee,
Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the world, we forget thee.
Shadowed beneath thy hand,
may we forever stand,
True to our God, true to our native land.\

Lift ev'ry voice and sing
till earth and heaven ring!\
Let us march on till victory is won - victory is won!
