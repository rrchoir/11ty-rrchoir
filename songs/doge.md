# DOGE is to Blame!
_Modified lyrics to Home on the Range by Nikki Nesbary_

**Oh give me a home where Democracy roams**  
And we value all government work!  
With no forks in the road  
Or forced retirement woes  
And our country has not gone berserk!  

**DOGE, DOGE is to blame**  
For this mess that they cannot contain  
Under cover of night  
They’ve tried to take all our rights   
But we won’t back down without a fight!!  

**Well OPM says, you can sign up and pledge**  
To retire and just walk away  
From job security, into uncertainty (With no guarantee?)  
Thats what Elon calls efficiency!  

**DOGE, DOGE is to blame**  
For this mess that they cannot contain  
Under cover of night  
They’ve tried to take all our rights  
**But we won’t back down without a fight!!**  

**DOGE, DOGE is to blame**  
For this mess that they cannot contain  
Under cover of night  
They’ve tried to take all our rights  
**But we won’t back down without a fight!!**  
**No, we won’t back down without a fight!!**
