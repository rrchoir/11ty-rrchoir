# Stand By Me
  
When the night has come  
And the land is dark  
And the moon is the only light we'll see  
No I won't be afraid, Oh I won't be afraid  
Just as long as you stand, stand by me  
  
[Chorus]  
So darling, darling  
Stand by me, oh, stand by me  
Oh stand, stand by me,  
Stand by me.  
  
If the sky that we look upon  
Should tumble and fall  
Or the mountains should crumble to the sea  
I won't cry, I won't cry  
No I won't shed a tear  
Just as long as you stand, stand by me  
  
*Chorus x2  *
  
Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me  
Oh stand by me, oh won't you stand now, stand by me
