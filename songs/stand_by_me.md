When the night has come\
And the land is dark\
And the moon is the only light we'll see\
No I won't be afraid, Oh I won't be afraid\
Just as long as you stand, stand by me  

\[Chorus]\
So darling, darling\
Stand by me, oh, stand by me\
Oh stand, stand by me,\
Stand by me.  

If the sky that we look upon\
Should tumble and fall\
Or the mountains should crumble to the sea\
I won't cry, I won't cry\
No I won't shed a tear\
Just as long as you stand, stand by me  

*Chorus x2*  

Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me\
Oh stand by me, oh won't you stand now, stand by me
