We are a gentle angry people\
And we are singing, singing for our lives\
(Repeat both lines)  

*Other verses*\
We are a justice-seeking people\
We are a land of many colors\
We are a peaceful, loving people\
We are all in this together\
We are queer and straight together\
We are cis and trans together
