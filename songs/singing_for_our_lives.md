# Singing For Our Lives
  
We are a gentle angry people  
And we are singing, singing for our lives  
(Repeat both lines)  
  
*Other verses  *
We are a justice-seeking people  
We are a land of many colors  
We are a peaceful, loving people  
We are all in this together  
We are gay and straight together
