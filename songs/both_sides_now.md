Rows and floes of angel hair\
And ice cream castles in the air\
And feather canyons everywhere\
I've looked at clouds that way  

But now they only block the sun\
They rain and snow on everyone\
So many things I would have done\
But clouds got in my way  

\[Chorus]\
I've looked at clouds from both sides now\
From up and down, and still somehow\
It's cloud illusions I recall\
I really don't know clouds at all  

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels\
The dizzy dancing way you feel\
As every fairy tale comes real\
I've looked at love that way  

But now it's just another show\
You leave 'em laughing when you go\
And if you care, don't let them know\
Don't give yourself away  

\[Chorus]\
I've looked at love from both sides now\
From give and take, and still somehow\
It's love's illusions I recall\
I really don't know love at all  

Tears and fears and feeling proud\
To say "I love you" right out loud\
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds\
I've looked at life that way  

But now old friends are acting strange\
They shake their heads, they say I've changed\
Well, something's lost, but something's gained\
In living every day  

\[Chorus]\
I've looked at life from both sides now\
From win and lose and still somehow\
It's life's illusions I recall\
I really don't know life at all
