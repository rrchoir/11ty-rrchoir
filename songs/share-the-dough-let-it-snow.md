Though the minimum wage is frightful\
For the wealthy, life's delightful\
Tell those billionaire CEOs\
Share the dough, share the dough, share the dough!

The battle around us rages\
As we fight for living wages\
And we want to get what we're owed\
Share the dough, share the dough, share the dough!

[_Bridge_]\
When we Leave family home at Night\
Working Two jobs a day is the Norm\
It's Really not a good Choice\
Do we Want to eat or stay Warm?

The economy's globalizing\
In the streets we're organizing\
And we're making our movement grow\
Share the dough, share the dough, share the dough!
