# Rise as One
  
  
It is we who serve the lunches, we who sweep the floors  
We who drive the busses with your children off to school  
We keep the buildings warm in winter, and cool when it's hot  
And we will not let you play us for the fool  
When we ask for better healthcare, or an increase in our wage  
You tell us that the township can't afford to pay the bill  
But you found half a million dollars from within those very coffers  
To try and break the union's back and break our will  
  
  
[Chorus]  
And we will never give up, we will never give in  
And we'll never, ever go away  
We will build a brand new future for our daughters and our sons  
We will work 'til all workers rise as one  
  
We believe in education and the future of our town  
And the children that we serve from day to day  
Whenever there's a need we always go the extra mile  
God knows we do it for the love, not for the pay  
But we have worked as hard as any for every inch of ground  
That we've gained in the struggle for our rights  
And we will not stand by idly as you try to tear us down  
If we have to we will organize a strike  
  
  
*Chorus*  
  
Well we didn't have a penny in our strike fund, sad but true  
That made us all a little bit afraid  
But the call went out to every other union in the state  
And somehow all the workers' bills were paid  
You see this isn't just the schools within our town  
When we dare to raise our voice in solidarity we stand  
With every other worker all the world around  
  
  
*Chorus*  
  
We held a rally at the fairgrounds, to show them our resolve  
And to drum up some support for our campaign  
A thousand people hit the street, and that's more than half our town  
And after that, you know things couldn't be the same  
Now whoever would've guessed it, when this whole thing began  
We'd have the strength to hold out for so long  
But three months have now gone by and the school board just gave in  
On their demands, now we can sing our victory song  
  
  
*Chorus*  

We will build a brand new future for our daughters and our sons  
We will work 'til all workers rise as one
