\# Woke up This Morning (Stayed on Freedom)



Well I woke up this morning with my mind stayed on freedom\
Well I woke up this morning with my mind stayed on freedom\
Well I woke up this morning with my mind stayed on freedom



Hallelu (Hallelu)

Hallelu (Hallelu)

Hallelujah!





Oh well I'm walking and talking with my mind stayed on freedom … \[ 3x ]





I'm singing and shouting with my mind stayed on freedom … \[ 3x ]



\[ Repeat again with “stayed on justice”]
