I've *sung* this song but I'll *sing* it again\
of the *place* that I worked as a *civ*il servant\
In *Trump* era *two*, and *ev*ery damn *day*
*Here*'s what the *fed*eral *work*ers now *say*

So long, it's been good to know ya\
So long, it's been good to know ya\
So long, it's been good to know ya\
*Ole* Rusty *Vought* loves his *trau*ma and *pain*\
And I *hope* to work *with* you a*gain*

A *DöGE* storm hit and it *hit* like thunder\
They RTO'd, DERP'd, and RIF'd us all under\
Killed USAID, eigh*teen*-F and all\
And *stole* the Peace *Inst*itute's *home* on the *Mall* (sayin')

So long, it's been good to know ya
So long, it's been good to know ya
So long, it's been good to know ya
*Ole* Rusty *Vought* loves his *trau*ma and *pain*
And I *hope* to work *with* you a*gain*

We *fore*cast the *weat*her; will you *soon* have to *pay*?\
*Built* Direct *File*, but In*tu*it said "Nay"\
*Rec*ommended *vac*cines but *now* measles *reigns*\
Bobby *Jun*ior is *tak*ing us *back*ward a*gain*  

So long, it's been good to know ya\
So long, it's been good to know ya\
So long, it's been good to know ya\
*Ole* Rusty *Vought* loves his *trau*ma and *pain*
And I *hope* to work *with* you a*gain*

I *won*'t break the *law*, I *won't* bend the *knee*\
To the *CON*stitution is *my* loyal*ty*
To *break* with my *cons*cience I'd *rath*er be *dead*
I'll *ten*der my REsig*nati*on in*stead*, singing...

So long, it's been good to know ya\
So long, it's been good to know ya\
So long, it's been good to know ya\
*Ole* Rusty *Vought* loves his *trau*ma and *pain*
And I *hope* to work *with* you a*gain*
(*repeat*)

Variations:

* For TTSer's "worked in tech transformation" instead of "as a civil servant"
* Instead of Russ Vought, "That tangerine clown is a-gettin' me down; And I have to be driftin' along"
