So long, it's been good to know ya\
So long, it's been good to know ya\
So long, it's been good to know ya\
That tangerine clown has gotten me down.  
And I've got to be driftin' along

A DOGE storm hit and it hit like thunder\
They RTO'd, DERP'd, and RIF'd us all under\
Wiped out USAID, 18F and all\
And stole the Peace Institute's home on the Mall

So long, it's been good to know ya\
So long, it's been good to know ya\
So long, it's been good to know ya\
That tangerine clown has gotten me down.  
And I've got to be driftin' along

We used to forecast the weather; will you soon have to pay?  
We built Direct File, but Intuit said "Nay"  
We recommended vaccines but now measles reigns  
Bobby Jr is taking us backward again  

So long, it's been good to know ya\
So long, it's been good to know ya\
So long, it's been good to know ya\
Ole Rusty Vought loves his trauma and pain  
But I hope to work... with you all again
(_repeat_)
