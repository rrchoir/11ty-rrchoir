# So Long It's Been Good to Know Ya

_Parody lyrics by Peter Burkholder_

So long, it's been good to know ya  
So long, it's been good to know ya  
So long, it's been good to know ya  
This ketamine Musk is a-takin my job  
And I've got to be driftin' along

A DOGE storm hit and it hit like thunder  
They RTO'd, DERP'd, and RIF'd us all under  
Wiped out USAID, CFPB and all  
And stole the Peace Institute's home on the Mall

So long, it's been good to know ya  
So long, it's been good to know ya  
So long, it's been good to know ya  
This ketamine Musk is a-takin my job  
And I've got to be driftin' along

We used to forecast the weather, now you'll soon have to pay  
We built Direct File, but Intuit said "Nay"  
We inspected our food but now E coli reigns  
DOGE is taking us backward again  

So long, it's been good to know ya  
So long, it's been good to know ya  
So long, it's been good to know ya  
This ketamine Musk has been gettin us down  
Time for us to all rally 'round
