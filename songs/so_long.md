I've sung this song but I'll sing it again  
of the place that I worked as a civil servant
In a term that goes fourteen hundred days  
And here's what the federal workers now say

So long, it's been good to know ya\
So long, it's been good to know ya\
So long, it's been good to know ya\
Ole Rusty Vought loves his trauma and pain  
And I hope to work with you again

A DOGE storm hit and it hit like thunder\
They RTO'd, DERP'd, and RIF'd us all under\
Killed USAID, 18F and all\
And stole the Peace Institute's home on the Mall (sayin')

So long, it's been good to know ya\
So long, it's been good to know ya\
So long, it's been good to know ya\
Ole Rusty Vought loves his trauma and pain  
And I hope to work with you again

We forecast the weather; will you soon have to pay?  
We built Direct File, but Intuit said "Nay"  
Recommended vaccines but now measles reigns  
Bobby Jr is taking us backward again  

So long, it's been good to know ya\
So long, it's been good to know ya\
So long, it's been good to know ya\
Ole Rusty Vought loves his trauma and pain  
And I hope to work with you again
(_repeat_)


Variations:
- For TTSer's "worked in tech transformation" instead of "as a civil servant"
- Instead of Russ Vought, "That tangerine clown is a-gettin' me down; And I have to be driftin' along"
