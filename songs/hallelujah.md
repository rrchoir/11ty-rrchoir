# Hallelujah

[_Verse 1_]  
I've heard there was a secret chord  
That David played, and it pleased the Lord  
But you don't really care for music, do you?  
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth  
The minor fall, the major lift  
The baffled king composing Hallelujah  

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah  

[_Verse 2_]  
Well your faith was strong, but you needed proof  
You saw her bathing on the roof  
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you  
Well she tied you to her kitchen chair  
She broke your throne and cut your hair  
And from your lips she drew Hallelujah  

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah  

[_Verse 3_]  
Baby I've been here before  
I've seen this room, and I've walked the floor  
I used to live alone before I knew you  
But I've seen your flag on the marble arch  
Our love is not a victory march  
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah  

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
  
[_Verse 4_]  
Maybe there's a God above  
But all I ever learned from love  
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you  
It's not a cry that you hear at night  
It's not some one who's seen the light  
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah  

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu-    
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
  
<!-- 


I did my best, it wasn't much  
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch  
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you  
And even though  
It all went wrong  
I'll stand before the Lord of Song  
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah  
  
You say I took the Name in vain  
I don't even know the Name  
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?  
There's a blaze of light  
In every word  
It doesn't matter which you heard  
The holy or the broken Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
-->

* Notes: It's tough to pick one song from the legion of amazing Canadian
songwriters. But this song made the cut for k. d. lang's collection of 
Canadian music in Hymns of the 49th Parallel, and Hillary Clinton (
as played by Kate McKinnon) sang this on Saturday Night Live 
after her electoral defeat in 2016. Please join in the chorus - the words 
are just: Hallelujah
  * These are k. d. lang's lyrics
