  It's tough to pick one song from the legion of amazing Canadian
  songwriters. But this song made the cut for k. d. lang's collection of 
  Canadian music in Hymns of the 49th Parallel, and Hillary Clinton (
  as played by Kate McKinnon) sang this on Saturday Night Live 
  after her electoral defeat in 2016. Please join in the chorus - the words 
  are just: Hallelujah

  * These are k. d. lang's lyrics

[*Verse 1*]\
I've heard there was a secret chord\
That David played, and it pleased the Lord\
But you don't really care for music, do you?\
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth\
The minor fall, the major lift\
The baffled king composing Hallelujah  

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah  

[*Verse 2*]\
Well your faith was strong, but you needed proof\
You saw her bathing on the roof\
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you\
Well she tied you to her kitchen chair\
She broke your throne and cut your hair\
And from your lips she drew Hallelujah  

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah  

[*Verse 3*]\
Baby I've been here before\
I've seen this room, and I've walked the floor\
I used to live alone before I knew you\
But I've seen your flag on the marble arch\
Our love is not a victory march\
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah  

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah  

[*Verse 4*]\
Maybe there's a God above\
But all I ever learned from love\
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you\
It's not a cry that you hear at night\
It's not some one who's seen the light\
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah  

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu-\
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah  

<!-- 


I did my best, it wasn't much  
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch  
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you  
And even though  
It all went wrong  
I'll stand before the Lord of Song  
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah  
  
You say I took the Name in vain  
I don't even know the Name  
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?  
There's a blaze of light  
In every word  
It doesn't matter which you heard  
The holy or the broken Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
