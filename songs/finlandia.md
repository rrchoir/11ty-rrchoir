  In February 1899, a manifesto from Tsar Nicholas II declared Russia’s right to
  rule Finland without the consent of local legislators. Sibelius’ choice of
  Finlandia as a title for the composition served as a subtle form of protest
  against Russian censorship; however, that censorship was so intense that it
  couldn’t be performed publically as Finlandia, so other titles were devised
  including “Happy Feelings at the Awakening of Finnish Spring.” Finlandia
  became a symbol of Finnish nationalism. While Finland was still a Grand Duchy
  under Russia performances within the empire had to take place under the covert
  title of “Impromptu”.


  Lloyd Stone (1912-1993), an American public school teacher who lived in Hawaii, authored 10 books of poetry and two children’s books. He wrote the first two stanzas of “This Is My Song” for its inclusion in the collection, Sing a Tune (1934). During the brief time of peace between two world wars, it was a song of hope for all nations—“for lands afar and mine.”


  Susan Briehl, staff lyricist for GIA publications, wrote the third verse for Marty Haugen's arrangement.


  Modified lyrics: To be less religious/more inclusive. Verse 1 changed “O God of all the nations” to “A song for all the nations”. Verse 2 changed “God” to “Thou”. Verse 3 changed “O God of all creation” to “A song for all creation” and “Your glorious vision” to “a glorious vision”.

This is my song, a song for all the nations,\
A song of peace for lands afar and mine.\
This is my home, the country where my heart is,\
Here are my hopes, my dreams, my holy shrine.\
But other hearts in other lands are beating,\
With hopes and dreams as true and high as mine.  

My country's skies are bluer than the ocean,\
And sunlight beams on clover leaf and pine.\
But other lands have sunlight too, and clover,\
And skies are everywhere as blue as mine.\
O hear my song, oh thou of all the nations,\
A song of peace for your land and for mine.  

Teach us to sing a song for all creation,\
A song of hope for ocean, sky, and pine.\
Teach us to walk the way that ends division,\
Till every land and nation love entwines.\
Then will all peoples see a glorious vision:\
The world at peace, beloved and divine.
