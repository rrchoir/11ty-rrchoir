This is my song, a song for all the nations,\
A song of peace for lands afar and mine.\
This is my home, the country where my heart is,\
Here are my hopes, my dreams, my holy shrine.\
But other hearts in other lands are beating,\
With hopes and dreams as true and high as mine.  

My country's skies are bluer than the ocean,\
And sunlight beams on clover leaf and pine.\
But other lands have sunlight too, and clover,\
And skies are everywhere as blue as mine.\
O hear my song, oh thou of all the nations,\
A song of peace for your land and for mine.  

Teach us to sing a song for all creation,\
A song of hope for ocean, sky, and pine.\
Teach us to walk the way that ends division,\
Till every land and nation love entwines.\
Then will all peoples see a glorious vision:\
The world at peace, beloved and divine.
