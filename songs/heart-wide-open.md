*Tenor/Melody:*\
Keep your heart wide open,\
Though the waves want to push you around.\
You've got to keep your heart wide open,\
'Til your faith brings you back to solid ground.

*Alto/Soprano/Bass:*\
I'm gonna keep, I'm gonna keep,\
I'm gonna keep my heart wide open\
Though the waves wanna push\
Though the waves wanna push me around.\
I'm gonna keep, I'm gonna keep,\
I'm gonna keep my heart wide open,\
'Til my faith brings me back,\
'Till my faith brings me back to solid ground.
