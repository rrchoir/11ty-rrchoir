Though the waves want to push you around.\
You gottta keep your heart wide open,\
'Til your faith brings you back to solid ground.

We're gonna keep our hearts wide open,
Though the waves want to push us around.
 We're gonna keep our heart wide open,
'Til our faith brings us back to solid ground.

We're gonna keep, we're  gonna keep,
We're  gonna keep our hearts wide open
Though the waves wanna push
Though the waves wanna push us around.

We're  gonna keep our hearts wide open
'Til our faith brings us back,
'Til our faith brings us back to solid ground.
