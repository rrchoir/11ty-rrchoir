# This Little Light
  
This little light of mine  
I'm gonna let it shine  
This little light of mine  
I'm gonna let it shine  
This little light of mine  
I'm gonna let it shine  
Let it shine, shine, shine, let it shine  
  
Everywhere I go. . .  
All around the world. . .  
Hide it under a bushel, No!. . .  
All around DC. . .  
For love and dignity. . .
