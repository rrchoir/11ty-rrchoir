This little light of mine\
I'm gonna let it shine\
This little light of mine\
I'm gonna let it shine\
This little light of mine\
I'm gonna let it shine\
Let it shine, shine, shine, let it shine  

Everywhere I go. . .\
All around the world. . .\
Hide it under a bushel, No!. . .\
All around DC. . .\
For love and dignity. . .
