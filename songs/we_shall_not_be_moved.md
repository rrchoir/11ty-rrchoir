notes: The origins of this song are unclear. Some believe it was a Spiritual
  from the days of slavery. It eventually appeared in hymnals as "I Shall Not Be
  Moved". During the labor movements of the 1940s and 50s, it was changed to "We
  Shall Not Be Moved" and used this way, with changing verses, in many protest
  movements worldwide to the present.

We shall not, we shall not be moved\
We shall not, we shall not be moved\
Like a tree that's planted by the water\
We shall not be moved  

*No,no, no nos moverán!\
No, no, no nos moverán\
Como un árbol firme junto al rio\
No nos moverán*  

We're on the road to justice,\
we shall not be moved ...

*Unidos en la lucha, no nos moverán\
Unidos en la lucha, no nos moverán\
Como un árbol firme junto al rio\
No nos moverán*  

> [*interim verses*]\
> We’ll ground Avelo Airlines, we shall not be moved…\
> We’ll shame collaborators, we shall not be moved…\
> Fighting for the climate, we shall not be moved…\
> Federal Workers Matter, we shall not be moved…\
> We will win together, we shall not be moved...

[*Last verses*]\
We shall not, we shall not be moved...

*No, no, no nos moverán...*
