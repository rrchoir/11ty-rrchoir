notes: The origins of this song are unclear. Some believe it was a Spiritual
  from the days of slavery. It eventually appeared in hymnals as "I Shall Not Be
  Moved". During the labor movements of the 1940s and 50s, it was changed to "We
  Shall Not Be Moved" and used this way, with changing verses, in many protest
  movement worldwide to the present.

# We Shall Not be Moved / No nos Moveran

We shall not, we shall not be moved  
We shall not, we shall not be moved  
Like a tree that's planted by the water  
We shall not be moved  

_No,no, no nos moverán!  
No, no, no nos moverán  
Como un árbol firme junto al rio  
No nos moverán_  

We're on the road to justice,  
we shall not be moved ...

_Unidos en la lucha, no nos moverán  
Unidos en la lucha, no nos moverán  
Como un árbol firme junto al rio  
No nos moverán_  

> [_interim verses_]  
> We’ll ground Avelo Airlines, we shall not be moved…  
> We’ll shame collaborators, we shall not be moved…  
> Fighting for the climate, we shall not be moved…    
> Federal Workers Matter, we shall not be moved…    
> We will win together, we shall not be moved...

[_Last verses_]  
We shall not, we shall not be moved...

_No, no, no nos moverán..._
