  Lissa Schneckenburger is a fiddle player and singer whose roots are in folk music in Maine. She lives in Brattleboro, Vermont, now, and says, “To me, music creates community. Music is what people sing along to, dance to, fall in love to… music brings people together." Giving concerts on her own or as part of the trio, Low Lily, as well as supporting other musicians with practice challenges (and jokes) through her website, Lissa consistently does her part to build community. 

  Lissa wrote this song after the 2016 election. Her trio, Low Lily, recorded it in March 2018. Andrea Ramsey arranged it for SATB choir.

My mother *\[chosen],* when love is gone\
My mother *\[chosen],* when love is gone\
In our darkest hour, hope lingers on\
My father *\[family],* when peace is gone\
My father *\[family],* when peace is gone\
In our darkest hour, hope lingers on

*Chorus:*\
I will not hate, and I will not fear\
In our darkest hour, hope lingers here

My sister *\[sibling]*, when equality’s gone\
My sister *\[sibling]*, when equality’s gone\
In our darkest hour, hope lingers on\
My brother *\[neighbor]*, with tolerance gone\
My brother *\[neighbor]*, with tolerance gone \
In our darkest hour, hope lingers on

\[Chorus]

My love, when honor is gone\
My love, when honor is gone \
In our darkest hour, hope lingers on\
My country, when justice is gone\
My country, when justice is gone\
In our darkest hour, hope lingers on

\[Chorus x 2]
