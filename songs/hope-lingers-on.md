My parents, when love is gone (2x)\
In our darkest hour hope lingers on

My neighbors, when peace is gone....

Chorus\
I will not hate\
And I will not fear\
In our darkest hour\
Hope lingers here

My siblings, when equality’s gone ....

My children, with tolerance gone....

Chorus

My love, when honor is gone....

My country, when justice is gone....

Chorus
