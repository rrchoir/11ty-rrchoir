# Lead with Love / One Foot

[Chorus]  
You gotta put one foot in front of the other and lead with love  
Put one foot in front of the other and lead with love  
You gotta put one foot in front of the other and lead with love  
Put one foot in front of the other and lead with love  

Don’t give up hope!  
You’re not alone  
Don’t you give up  
Keep movin’ on  

*Chorus*  
   
Lift up your eyes  
Don’t you despair  
Look up ahead  
The path is there  

*Chorus*  
  
I know you’re scared  
Well I’m scared too  
But look at me  
Right next to you  
  
*Chorus*  

And lead with love (3 more times)
