notes: Melanie DeMore wrote this song the day after the 2016 election. She was
  doing a residency in a middle school in Minneapolis-St Paul with a strong
  Latinx and African American population. The day after the election, her black
  students wondered if they were going to be slaves again. The Latino students
  thought their grandmas would be taken away in the middle of the night. She
  told them "There are more people with you than against you". She reminded them
  that great leaders like MLK Jr started their movements out of the love of
  their people, not their hatred of someone else. "So you gotta lead with love."

\[Chorus]\
You gotta put one foot in front of the other and lead with love\
Put one foot in front of the other and lead with love\
You gotta put one foot in front of the other and lead with love\
Put one foot in front of the other and lead with love  

Don’t give up hope!\
You’re not alone\
Don’t you give up\
Keep movin’ on  

*Chorus*  

Lift up your eyes\
Don’t you despair\
Look up ahead\
The path is there  

*Chorus*  

I know you’re scared\
Well I’m scared too\
But look at me\
Right next to you  

*Chorus*  

And lead with love (3 more times)  [](/_Media/one_foot_high.mp3)
