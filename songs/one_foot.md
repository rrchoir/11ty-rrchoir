notes: Melanie DeMore wrote this song the day after the 2016 election. She was
  doing a residency in a middle school in Minneapolis-St Paul with a strong
  Latinx and African American population. The day after the election, a couple
  of her black students asked her "Miss Melanie, does this mean we're going to
  be slaves again?" The Latino students thought they're going to take away my
  grandma in the middle of the night. She said "They're gonna have to come
  through me first" and "There are more people with you than against you". She
  reminded them that great leaders like MLK Jr started their movements out of
  the love of their people, not their hatred of someone else. "So you gotta lead
  with love."

\[Chorus]\
You gotta put one foot in front of the other and lead with love\
Put one foot in front of the other and lead with love\
You gotta put one foot in front of the other and lead with love\
Put one foot in front of the other and lead with love  

Don’t give up hope!\
You’re not alone\
Don’t you give up\
Keep movin’ on  

*Chorus*  

Lift up your eyes\
Don’t you despair\
Look up ahead\
The path is there  

*Chorus*  

I know you’re scared\
Well I’m scared too\
But look at me\
Right next to you  

*Chorus*  

And lead with love (3 more times)
