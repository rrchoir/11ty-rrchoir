# Down by the Riverside

I’m gonna lay down my burden (clap, clap!)\
Down by the riverside\
Down by the riverside\
Down by the riverside  

I’m gonna lay down my burden (clap, clap!)\
Down by the riverside\
I ain’t gonna study war* no more  

[*Chorus*]\
I ain’t gonna study war no more,\
ain’t gonna study war no more,\
ain’t gonna study war no more (2x)  

[*Additional verses*]\
I’m gonna lay down my sword and shield. . .\
I'm gonna shake hands with my neighbor...\
I'm gonna stand up for justice...  

\* *follow song leader for actual chorus*
