# Draw the Circle Wide

Draw the circle, draw the circle wide (2x)  
Let this be our song: No one stands a lone  
Weâ€™ll stand side by side   
Draw the circle, draw the circle wide (repeat)  
  
  
Draw the circle, draw it wider still  
Let this be our song, be our song: no one stands a lone  
Standing side by side  
Draw the circle, draw the circle wide  
  
  
In your sadness & in your grief  
All the pain, it seems there's no relief  
We will hold you until the storm subsides  
Draw the circle, draw the circle wide
