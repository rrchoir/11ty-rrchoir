# Rich Man's House

Well I, went down to the rich man's house and I  
Took back what he stole from me  
(Took it back)  
Took back my dignity  
(Took it back)  
Took back my humanity [_repeat_]
  
Now we’re out in the streets,
out in the streets,
out in the streets,
out in the streets,
Ain't gonna let no fascists take our democracy!  
  
Well I, went down to the… White House/ Court House/ Consulate/ Border/Tesla Store/U.S. AID….
