notes: "Rich Man’s House is a Poor People’s Campaign song. It was written by
  poor families of the Kensington Welfare Rights Union during the New Freedom
  Bus Tour in 1998. They stopped at church in Durham, North Carolina where the
  congregation sang “Enemy’s Camp”, which talks about taking back the things
  Satan has taken. The next night around a campfire, they started playing with
  the lyrics and changed it to taking back what was stolen from them by the
  system: their dignity and humanity."

Well I, went down to the rich man's house and I\
Took back what he stole from me\
(Took it back)\
Took back my dignity\
(Took it back)\
Took back my humanity [*repeat*]

Now we’re out in the streets,
out in the streets,
out in the streets,
out in the streets,
Ain't gonna let no fascists take our democracy!  

Well I, went down to the… White House/ Court House/ Consulate/ Border/Tesla Store/U.S. AID….
