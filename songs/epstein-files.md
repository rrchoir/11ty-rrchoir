Epstein files, Epstein files,\
Please expose them completely,\
Your denial's out of style,\
Now you're coming off weakly.\
What’s in them so heinous you can’t show? \
Prove you're no transgressor.\
Epstein files, Epstein files,\
Yes, they'll haunt you forever.

*Repeat, ending with:*\
May they haunt you forever.
