I walk in the spirit, I walk in the light\
I walk through the darkest hours of  night\
And I call on my ancestors to the left and the right\
To walk with with me, to walk with with me

Replace the the 2nd line with:

I walk in the service of doing what's right

I walk in the knowledge that we'll be all right

I walk with my neighbors to fight the good fight

I walk with the promise of healing in sight
