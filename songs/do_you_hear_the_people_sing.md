# Do You Hear the People Sing?

Do you hear the people sing?  
Singing a song of angry men.  
It is the music of a people  
Who will not be slaves again.  
  
When the beating of your heart  
Echoes the beating of the drums  
There is a life about to start  
When tomorrow comes.  
  
Will you join in our crusade?  
Who will be strong and stand with me?  
Beyond the barricade  
Is there a world you long to see?  
Then join in the fight  
That will give you the right to be free.  
  
[_Repeat first 2 stanzas_]  
  
Will you give all you can give  
So that our banner may advance?  
Some will fall and some will live.  
Will you stand up and take your chance?  
The blood of the martyrs  
Will water the meadows of France.  
  
[_Repeat first 2 stanzas._]
