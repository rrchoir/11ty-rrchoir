WE WISH YOU A HAPPY HOLIDAY

Chorus:

We wish you a Happy Holiday\
We wish you a Happy Holiday\
We wish you a Happy Holiday\
And an Organized Year!

We thank one and all\
For support that you bring\
Through the halls of our workplace\
Solidarity rings! (Chorus)

On Kwanza or Christmas\
Hannukah too\
A season of justice\
Is our wish to you! (Chorus)

May members be strong\
And grievances slight\
May your Union spirit\
Be bold and be bright! (Chorus)

RUDOLPH THE UNION REINDEER

Rudolph the Union reindeer\
Pulled the sleigh for old St. Nick\
He signed a Union contract\
He knew North Pole politics

All of the other reindeer\
Worked long hours around the clock\
They paid no heed to Rudolph\
They worked in non-union shops

Then one year on Christmas Eve\
They all came to say,\
"We will do what you advise\
Rudolph, help us organize!"

Then how the reindeer loved him\
As they lined up with their sleigh\
Now when they work on Christmas\
They're all getting premium pay.



I’M DREAMING OF A JUST WORKPLACE

I’m dreaming of a just workplace\
Where every worker’s organize\
Where the law protects us\
The boss respects us \
And no jobs have been downsized. 

I’m dreaming of a just workplace \
With every union card that’s signed. \
At this holiday may we find \
Solidarity and peace of mind


I’m dreaming of a just workplace \
Where every worker gets their share \
Where the company’s profits \
Will reach our pockets 
And we’re all treated fair and square. 

I’m dreaming of a just workplace \
With every campaign we begin, \
Until justice comes before greed, \
And our workplace rights are guaranteed



HERE'S TO OUR STEWARDS

Tune: Frosty the Snowman

Here's to our stewards!\
They're the Union's heart and soul\
Every worker goes to these heroes\
When injustice takes its toll.

Here's to our stewards!\
When the conflict is intense\
If the boss gets rough, they will stand with us\
They're our first line of defense.

There seems to be no end to grievance forms\
 that they compile\
And they're completely awesome\
 when they defend the rank-and-file!

Here's to our stewards!\
They know every contract clause\
Bring the New Year in by awarding them\
unanimous applause!
